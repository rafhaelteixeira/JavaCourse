Create an abstract class called Animal with abstract methods eat() and makeSound().
Then create two subclasses of Animal called Dog and Cat. Implement the eat() method in each subclass
to print out what each animal eats, and implement the makeSound() method to print out the sound each animal makes.
 Finally, create a main class to test the functionality by creating instances of both Dog and Cat and calling the
 eat() and makeSound() methods on each instance.
