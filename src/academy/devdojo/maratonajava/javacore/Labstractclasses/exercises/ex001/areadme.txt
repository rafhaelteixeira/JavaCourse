Create an abstract class called Shape with an abstract method called calculateArea().
Then create two subclasses of Shape called Circle and Rectangle.
Implement the calculateArea() method in each subclass to calculate the area of a circle and a
rectangle respectively. Finally, create a main class to test the functionality by
creating instances of both subclasses and calling the calculateArea() method on each instance.
