Transportation System with Travel Planner:

Model a transportation system where different vehicles (Car, Bus, Train) inherit from a common Vehicle class.
Implement a common method travel() in each vehicle class to represent how each vehicle travels.
Develop a travel planner application where users can plan trips using different modes of transportation, leveraging polymorphism to handle travel options.
