Employee Training System: Create a training system where employees attend different types of training programs (Technical, Managerial, Soft Skills). Implement a method like conductTraining() and demonstrate polymorphism by conducting different training programs.

Identify Training Program Types: Determine the types of training programs employees can attend. For example, Technical Training, Managerial Training, and Soft Skills Training could be potential types.

Create a Training Program Class Hierarchy: Define a class hierarchy for different training programs. You can have an abstract base class (e.g., TrainingProgram) and concrete subclasses for each type of training program (e.g., TechnicalTraining, ManagerialTraining, SoftSkillsTraining). Each subclass should override the conductTraining() method according to the specific type of training.

Define Employee Class: Create an Employee class to represent employees. This class should have a method to attend training programs, such as attendTraining(TrainingProgram program).

Implement Polymorphism: In the attendTraining() method of the Employee class, accept a parameter of type TrainingProgram. This allows any subclass of TrainingProgram to be passed as an argument, enabling polymorphic behavior.

Instantiate Objects and Conduct Training: Create instances of different training programs (e.g., TechnicalTraining, ManagerialTraining, SoftSkillsTraining) and pass them to the attendTraining() method of employee objects. Since the method parameter accepts any subclass of TrainingProgram, polymorphism allows the appropriate conductTraining() method to be invoked based on the actual type of training program passed.

Testing: Test your implementation by creating various employee objects and training programs, and verify that polymorphism correctly handles the behavior of conducting different types of training.

By following these steps, you can implement the Employee Training System using polymorphism in Java effectively. This approach allows for flexibility and scalability in adding new types of training programs in the future without modifying existing code.
