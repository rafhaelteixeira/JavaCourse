Design a program for managing different types of currencies using enums in Java.
Define an enum called "Currency" with constants representing different currencies
such as USD, EUR, GBP, JPY, etc. Each currency should have a symbol associated with it.
Create a method that takes a Currency parameter and returns its symbol. Additionally, implement a
method to display all available currencies along with their symbols.
