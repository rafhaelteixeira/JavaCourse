Design a program for a library management system using enums.
Define an enum called "BookGenre" with constants representing different genres such as
Fiction, Mystery, Science Fiction, Non-Fiction, etc. Each book in the library should have a
title, author, year of publication, and genre. Create a class called "Book" to represent a
book with these attributes. Then, create a method in the library system that takes a BookGenre parameter
and returns a list of all books in the library belonging to that genre.
