Exercise: Card Suits

Create an enum called CardSuit to represent the four suits of a standard deck of playing cards:
Hearts, Diamonds, Clubs, and Spades. Implement methods to get the name and color of each suit.

Then, create a class called Card that has two properties:
rank (an integer from 1 to 13 representing the card's rank) and suit
(an instance of the CardSuit enum representing the card's suit).
Implement a method to get the full name of the card (e.g., "Ace of Hearts", "Queen of Diamonds").

Finally, create a Main class with a main method where you create several
Card objects and print out their full names.

This exercise will help you understand how to define and use enums in Java,
as well as how to use enums in conjunction with other classes.
