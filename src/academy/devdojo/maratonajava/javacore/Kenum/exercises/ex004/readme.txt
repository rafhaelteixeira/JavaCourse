Design a simple coffee ordering system using enums in Java.
Define an enum called "CoffeeType" with constants representing different types of coffee such as
Espresso, Latte, Cappuccino, etc. Each type of coffee should have a price associated with it.
Create a method that takes a CoffeeType parameter and returns the price of that type of coffee.
Additionally, implement a method to display all available types of coffee along with their prices.
