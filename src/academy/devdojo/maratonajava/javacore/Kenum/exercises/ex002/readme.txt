Design a simple application that models different types of transportation vehicles using enums in Java.
Define an enum called "Transportation" with constants representing different types of vehicles such as
car, bike, bus, train, etc. Then, create a method that takes a parameter of type Transportation and
prints out a message indicating the mode of transportation chosen.
