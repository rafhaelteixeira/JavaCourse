Exercise:

Create an interface named Vehicle with methods start() and stop(). Implement two classes: Car and Motorcycle, both implementing the Vehicle interface.

The Car class should override the start() method to print "Car started" and the stop() method to print "Car stopped".

The Motorcycle class should override the start() method to print "Motorcycle started" and the stop() method to print "Motorcycle stopped".

After implementing these classes, create a program that simulates a simple traffic scenario. Allow the user to create instances of Car and Motorcycle objects and simulate them starting and stopping at various points.

Additionally, you can extend this exercise by adding other vehicle types such as trucks or bicycles, each with their own implementations of the start() and stop() methods. 

This exercise provides a real-world scenario where interfaces are used to define common behaviors that different types of vehicles should implement. It helps you understand how interfaces can be applied to model systems with different implementations but similar behavior. Additionally, it provides practical application by simulating a real-world traffic scenario, which involves managing the start and stop actions of various vehicles.
