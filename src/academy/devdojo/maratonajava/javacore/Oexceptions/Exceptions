Exceptions like all things in java are objects

They come from the class Throwable, and subdivide into two others:
Error and Exception

Errors are situations where we can't recover from
for example: outOfMemmoryError
in this case we cannot do anything that the JVM did not try before. when we have an error, usually the JVM stops executing
Another one is the stack overflow error, when we overflow the stack memmory of a method call
see example on the StackOverflowTest01 class.

The Exception class also extends the Throwable class
we have two types of Exceptions

Checked: They are children of the Exception class directly and if not treated, they'll return an compilation error

Unchecked: they involve the RuntimeException Class as well as it's children. with those exceptions, almost everytime
they are thrown, some development mistake was made. i'ts not mandatory to treat them, but it is a good practice
see example on the RuntimeExceptionTest01

Exception
